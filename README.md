# DDOS-Tools
Grouping of most of the ddos tools that act on a single machine and do not interact with botnets, just initialize a certain type of request to a certain host

The tool depends upon including the tools and a single script to install them and a single script to run them

All of the DDOS various tools will be included in the parent folder

The parent folder will contain a setup.py file to install all of the various tools and install
a runnable command line interface to all of those tools (hopefully not just run them all :) )
